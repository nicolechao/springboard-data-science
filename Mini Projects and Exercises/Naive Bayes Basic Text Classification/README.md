# Naive Bayes Mini Project


## Problem: Basic Text Classification with Naive Bayes
Predict freshness of rotten tomatoes reviews using Naive Bayes.

## Data
The data set is a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database.

## Approach
1. EDA for the data.
2. Vectorize the reviews with CountVectorizer.
3. Train text classification model with Naive Bayes & tune hyperparameters with cross-validation.
4. Identify strong predictive words.

## Deliverables
1. EDA & Naive Bayes code in Python notebook.
